# MyCollection
An Android application (written in the Kotlin programming language) that allows users to document any "collections" that they may have. In addition to naming items in their collections, users can add descriptions and images as well. This was done as a term project for CS-592 (Mobile App Development) at The University of Alabama at Birmingham.
